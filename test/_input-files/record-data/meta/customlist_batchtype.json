If you check Update, a number is assigned to each existing record of that type, and the name is stored in a separate field.<br/></b><br/>You can return to this tab at any time to turn on or off numbering for new records; however, once numbered, records will be listed by number instead of by name.<br/>It typically takes just a few minutes for 5000 records. While it is running, this tab will not be available.<br/>",
